# c_thermometer

## Overview

This repo is for a small project to create a thermostat using some hobbiest parts. It will include part information, setup instructions, and code for application/interfacing with hardware.

## Parts

* Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with Header (including accesories like power supply, SD card, case, etc.)
* Inland 2.13 Inch E-Ink LCD Display Screen
* Inland DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
* Female-to-Female Jumper Wires

## E-Ink LCD Setup

This part is a clone of a similar Waveshare e-Paper HAT. Thus, to set up the device, the following wiki instructions can be followed: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_e-Paper_HAT_Manual. Important note: the SDI Pin is the same the DIN pin on the documentation. The rest of the pins should have similar naming.
